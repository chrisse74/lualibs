-- REQUIREMENT: set CONTEXTPATH environment variable to .../texmf-context

## Step 1
check for new context versions, needs a diff program, so run from git bash

     texlua whatsnew.lua

## Step 2

copy and rename new files (must be done manually as far as I can see)

   new 28.09.2018: it can be done with
   !!! needs a CONTEXTPATH environment variable that points to tex\texmf-context
   should be run from git bash too.

    texlua import-from-context.lua

## Step 3
- change the version and date in build.lua
- run l3build.lua tag
- Add version info to NEWS
- Enable unicode in lualibs-unicode (until we remove the dependency ...)


## Step 4
Unpack the dtx:

    l3build unpack

## Step 5 create the merged files in a context aware command line by running
   in build/unpacked

mtxrun --script package --merge lualibs-extended.lua
mtxrun --script package --merge lualibs-basic.lua

## Step 6

copy the merged files to the main folder (or l3build will delete them in the next step)

## Step 7

install the new files in the texmf tree of luaotfload with

     l3build install

(luaotfload folder should be beside lualibs folder)

Run
     mktexlsr

if needed

## Step 8

run tests (l3build check, luaotfload-tool -u)


## Step 9

Create CTAN-package

     l3build ctan
